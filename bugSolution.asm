; Before: This line attempts to access memory outside the bounds of the allocated buffer if ecx is too large
; After: We add a check to limit ecx to a safe range

mov ecx, 1000 ; Example value of ecx that might cause the error
mov ebx, buffer ; 'buffer' is assumed to be a pointer to a buffer of a certain size

; Added safety check. Assume the buffer has 256 elements (1024 bytes):
mov edx, 256 ; Number of elements in the buffer
cmp ecx, edx
jge out_of_bounds_handler ; Handle out-of-bounds access

; Access memory safely
